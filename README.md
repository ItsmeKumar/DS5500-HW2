<h2><center>Problem 2</center></h2>

I have chosen the following visualization to answer this question:
https://github.com/tonytontian/DS5500/tree/master/hw1

The visualization clearly explains the distribution of income (GDP / capita) across countries and continents over time. It looks very similar to my visulazation except that 5 static plots were used to show the distribution across 5 different years, where as I used an interactive slider to show the distribtion for each year. An interactive plot would have been more appropriate for this question, since it allows us to include more information about GDP per capita with respect to time.

The plots look easy to interpret and effectively visualizes what is asked but including an interactive plot could surely make it better.

<h2><center>Problem 3</center></h2>

I have chosen the following visualization to answer this question:
https://github.com/noahdemoes/DS5500_Homework1

The visualization explains relationship between income (GDP / capita), life expectancy, and child mortality over time. The plots look very different from the approach I have used. One of the major difference is having 3 separate static plots corresponding to visualize income, life expectancy, and child mortality over time. Instead, I have used a single plot to visualize all three variables with time as a slider.

The visulaztion is easy to interpret and is effective in visualizing what is asked in the question. But, having 3 different plots could make it hard for cross relational analysis of the 3 variables over time.
